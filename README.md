#Getting started
If this is your first time using react native, you'll need to work on some configurations depending on the system that you're running. Following the following instructions to setup your development environment with IOS or Android. https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device
    - If you're running a mac, the setup should be very simple. Open up the .xcode-project file w/ xcode in the ios directory and allow the project to build. X-code should have simulators installed and will default to using the latest iphone model. 

Currently using npm and yarn for package management. Might be able to remove npm so we only have one package manager. Additionally, i'm using nvm w/ an alias at v10.1.0
